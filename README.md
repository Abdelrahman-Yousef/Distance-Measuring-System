# Distance-Measuring-System
## I implemented the system to measure the distance using ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 with the specifications listed below:
### 1- I used ATmega32 Microcontroller with frequency 8Mhz.
### 2- I measured the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.
### 3- The LCD displays the distance value.
### 4- The project is designed and implemented based on the layered architecture model.
